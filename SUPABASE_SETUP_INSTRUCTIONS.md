# üöÄ Supabase Database Setup Instructions

## Problem
Your NEW Supabase project (`gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg`) has **no database tables** yet! The app needs tables to store user profiles and file orders.

## Solution
Run the SQL setup script in your Supabase dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg/editor**

Or:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: **`creative-studio-saas`** (gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg)
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

### 2. Create New Query
- Click the **"New query"** button (top right)

### 3. Paste the SQL Script

- Copy **ALL** the contents
- Paste into the SQL Editor

### 4. Run the Script

## Troubleshooting

### "Success. No rows returned"
‚úÖ This is GOOD! It means the script ran successfully.

### "relation already exists"
‚úÖ Also good! Means you already ran the script. Safe to ignore.

### "permission denied"
‚ùå Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project.

### Users can't sign up
1. Check if SQL script ran successfully
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Supabase URL in your app is correct: `gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg.supabase.co`
