# Configure Supabase Redirect URLs for Production

## Your Production Domain
https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open Supabase Authentication Settings

Go to your Supabase dashboard:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg/auth/url-configuration

Or navigate manually:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg`
3. Click **Authentication** (shield icon in left sidebar)
4. Click **URL Configuration**

### 2. Update Site URL

In the **Site URL** field, enter:
```
https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee
```

This is the main URL of your application.

### 3. Add Redirect URLs

In the **Redirect URLs** section, add these URLs (one per line):

```
https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/**
https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/**
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

**Why these URLs?**
- `https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/**` - Allows all paths on your production domain
- `/auth/callback` - Specific callback URL for password resets and email confirmations
- `localhost:3000/**` - Keeps local development working

### 4. Update Your Code (if needed)

Check your auth configuration files to ensure callbacks use the correct URL:

**src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx** should have:
```typescript
redirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`
```

This automatically uses the correct domain (production or local).

### 5. Save Changes

Click **Save** in the Supabase dashboard.

### 6. Test Authentication

**On Production (https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/):**
1. Go to your live site
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Register with a real email
4. Check your email for confirmation link
5. Click the link - should redirect to your site
6. Try "Forgot Password" flow

**On Local (http://localhost:3000/):**
1. Should still work for development
2. Test sign up/sign in locally

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid redirect URL" error
**Solution:** Make sure you added the URLs exactly as shown above, including the `/**` wildcard.

### Issue: Email links redirect to wrong domain
**Solution:** 
1. Check the **Site URL** is set to your production domain
2. Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Password reset doesn't work
**Solution:** Ensure `/auth/callback` is in the redirect URLs list.

## Environment Variables

Your production environment should have these set:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key-here
```

## Wildcard Pattern Explanation

The `**` pattern means:
- `https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/**` ‚Üí Allows ALL paths under your domain
  - ‚úÖ `/auth/callback`
  - ‚úÖ `/dashboard`
  - ‚úÖ `/reset-password`
  - ‚úÖ Any other path

## Security Note

Only add domains you control to prevent security issues. Never add:
- ‚ùå Wildcard domains like `*` or `*.com`
- ‚ùå Untrusted third-party domains
- ‚ùå HTTP domains in production (use HTTPS)

## Next Steps

After configuring:
1. ‚úÖ Deploy your app to production
2. ‚úÖ Test sign up on live site
3. ‚úÖ Test password reset flow
4. ‚úÖ Verify email confirmation works

Your authentication should now work seamlessly on both local and production! üéâ
