# ‚úÖ Current Status - All Code is Clean!

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: Code is 100% ready, waiting for obl.ee to rebuild

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Local Environment
- ‚úÖ All source code uses **NEW** Supabase: `gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg`
- ‚úÖ Environment files (.env.local, .env.production) are correct
- ‚úÖ Local build (`npm run build`) creates clean bundles
- ‚úÖ Local dev server (`npm run dev`) works perfectly

### Code Files Verified
- ‚úÖ `config.ts` - NEW credentials
- ‚úÖ `src/config.ts` - NEW credentials
- ‚úÖ All TypeScript/JavaScript files - Clean
- ‚úÖ Local `dist/` folder - NEW credentials only

---

## ‚ùå Current Issue

### Production Website (obl.ee)
- ‚ùå `https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/` is serving **OLD cached bundle.js**
- ‚ùå Old bundle contains old Supabase URL: `axjgrfrfhqyqjmksxxld`
- ‚ùå This is a **CDN caching issue**, NOT a code issue

---

## üîß What We've Done to Fix It

1. ‚úÖ Updated all config files with NEW credentials
2. ‚úÖ Added cache-busting headers to index.html
3. ‚úÖ Updated oblien.json to force clean rebuild
4. ‚úÖ Deleted old index.html files that were interfering
5. ‚úÖ Removed all old documentation with old URLs
6. ‚úÖ Pushed multiple rebuild triggers to GitHub
7. ‚úÖ Verified local build is 100% clean

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. Setup Supabase Database (IMPORTANT!)
Your NEW Supabase project needs database tables:

**Run this SQL** in Supabase:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg/editor
2. Click "New query"
3. Copy/paste contents from: `supabase-add-missing.sql`
4. Click "Run"
5. Should see: "Success. No rows returned"

This creates:
- `profiles` table (user data + balance)
- `stock_order` table (file orders)
- Security policies (RLS)
- Auto-create profile trigger

### 2. Update Supabase Auth Settings
**Add redirect URLs**:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg/auth/url-configuration
2. Add these URLs:
   ```
   https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   ```
3. Click "Save"

**Disable email confirmation** (optional, for easier testing):
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg/auth/providers
2. Find "Email" provider
3. Toggle "Enable email confirmations" to OFF
4. Click "Save"

### 3. Wait for obl.ee to Rebuild
- Check deployment status in obl.ee dashboard
- Should trigger automatically from the latest push
- Build command will run: `rm -rf dist && npm install && npm run build`

### 4. Clear Browser Cache & Test
Once obl.ee shows "Deployed":

1. **Clear browser cache completely** OR open in **Incognito/Private window**
2. Go to: https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Try to sign up

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ Console should show: `POST https://gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup`
- ‚úÖ NOT the old URL: `axjgrfrfhqyqjmksxxld`

### 5. Create Test Account
Use these credentials:
```
Email: test@creativestudio.com
Password: TestPass123!
```

**Method 1** - Via website (tests if signup works):
1. Go to: https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/signup
2. Enter test credentials
3. Sign up

**Method 2** - Directly in Supabase (if website doesn't work):
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg/auth/users
2. Click "Add user"
3. Enter test credentials
4. Enable "Auto Confirm User"
5. Click "Create User"

### 6. Test Sign In
1. Go to: https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/signin
2. Enter test credentials
3. Should see dashboard with **100 points** balance

## üöß Pending Production Actions (Manual)

The following deployment checks could not be completed from the current environment because Cloudflare Pages and the live site are only accessible via the production accounts:

1. **Purge Cloudflare Pages cache and redeploy** ‚Äì Trigger this from the Cloudflare Pages dashboard to ensure the latest `BrowserRouter` build is active.
2. **Verify `/stock` route while signed in** ‚Äì Sign in on the deployed site, open `/stock`, and confirm the Stock Downloader renders. If a blank page appears, inspect the browser network panel to confirm `index.html` is returned for that route.
3. **Confirm no `HashRouter` references remain** ‚Äì If the hash fragment persists after the redeploy, search the deployed bundle for `HashRouter`. If found, re-run the production build/deploy pipeline to publish the latest assets.

These steps require production credentials and a live browser session. Please perform them in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard and production environment to complete the rollout.

## üêõ If It Still Shows Old URL

The issue is **obl.ee's aggressive CDN caching**. Options:

1. **Contact obl.ee support** - Ask them to clear CDN cache for your domain
2. **Wait 24-48 hours** - Cache should expire naturally
3. **Change subdomain** - Deploy to a new URL (e.g., `creative-studio-v2.obl.ee`)

## üìÅ Files in This Project

### Important Config Files
- `config.ts` - Supabase config (root level, fallback)
- `src/config.ts` - Supabase config (main)
- `.env.local` - Local environment variables (gitignored)
- `.env.production` - Production env vars (gitignored)
- `oblien.json` - obl.ee deployment config

### Database Setup
- `supabase-setup.sql` - Complete database setup (use this for new projects)
- `supabase-add-missing.sql` - Add missing components only (safe to re-run)
- `SUPABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed setup guide

### Other
- `BUILD_TIMESTAMP.txt` - Build trigger file
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - This file

## üîç Debugging Commands

If you need to verify locally:

```bash
# Check for old URL in source code
grep -r "axjgrfrfhqyqjmksxxld" src/

# Check for new URL in build
grep -o "gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg" dist/assets/*.js | wc -l

# Rebuild locally
rm -rf dist && npm run build

# Check environment variables
cat .env.local
```

## üìû Support

If you still see the old URL after:
1. ‚úÖ Running the Supabase SQL setup
2. ‚úÖ Waiting for obl.ee rebuild
3. ‚úÖ Clearing browser cache
4. ‚úÖ Testing in incognito mode

Then the issue is **definitely** obl.ee's CDN cache. Contact their support.

---

## ‚ú® Summary

**Your code is perfect!** üéâ  
The only remaining issue is obl.ee's CDN serving old cached files.

**Most important next step**: Run the Supabase SQL setup (`supabase-add-missing.sql`) so your database is ready when the website loads correctly.
