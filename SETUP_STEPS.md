2. Select ALL the contents (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A)
3. Copy it (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)

## Step 3: Run the Script
1. In Supabase SQL Editor, click **New Query**
2. Paste the SQL you copied (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)
3. Click the green **Run** button (or press Cmd+Enter)

# Then restart it:
npm run dev
```

### If deployed (Railway/Vercel/etc):

## Step 5: Test the Admin Page

1. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   https://creative-studio-saas.pages.dev/admin/stock-sources
   ```

2. **What you should see:**
   - Total Sources: 39
   - Active: 38
   - A table with all stock sources

3. **Try editing a price:**
   - Click the ‚úèÔ∏è (pencil) icon next to any source
   - Change the price (e.g., change 0.50 to 0.60)
   - Click the ‚úì (checkmark) to save
   - The price should update immediately!

4. **Try toggling active status:**
   - Click the toggle switch next to any source
   - It should switch from active to inactive (or vice versa)

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "0 sources"?

**Check 1:** Did the SQL script run successfully?
- Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
- Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stock_sources;`
- Should return 39

**Check 2:** Did you restart the server?
- Make sure the backend restarted after the migration

**Check 3:** Check browser console
- Press F12 in your browser
- Look for any red errors
- Share them if you need help

### Can't edit prices?

**Check:** Are you logged in as an admin?
- Log out and log back in
- Make sure your user has admin role

---

## What's Next?

Once everything is working:

1. ‚úÖ **Edit prices** - Click edit icon, change price, save
2. ‚úÖ **View changes** - All edits are logged with your user ID
3. ‚úÖ **Disable sources** - Toggle off any sources you don't want users to see
4. ‚úÖ **Check audit log** - Run this in Supabase:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM stock_source_audit ORDER BY changed_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```
