# ✅ Syntax Error Fixed!

## The Problem

You were getting this error in Railway:

```
SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
file:///app/server.js:1361
const parsedLimit = Math.min(parseInt(limit as string, 10) || 50, 200);
```

## The Issue

I accidentally used TypeScript syntax (`as string`) in a JavaScript file (`server.js`). JavaScript doesn't support TypeScript type annotations like this.

## The Fix

Changed from:
```javascript
const parsedLimit = Math.min(parseInt(limit as string, 10) || 50, 200);
```

To:
```javascript
const parsedLimit = Math.min(parseInt(String(limit), 10) || 50, 200);
```

This uses `String()` to convert the value to a string, which is valid JavaScript.

## ✅ Fixed and Ready to Deploy!

Now you can deploy again:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix syntax error: Remove TypeScript annotation from JS file"
git push
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway to deploy, then refresh your admin page!

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and ready to deploy
