# ‚úÖ FINAL FIX APPLIED

## What Was Wrong

You had THREE index.html files:
1. `/index.html` (root) - OLD with CDN imports ‚ùå
2. `/public/index.html` - OLD ‚ùå
3. `/src/index.html` - NEW with cache headers ‚úÖ

obl.ee was serving the OLD root `index.html` instead of building with Vite!

## What I Fixed

‚úÖ Deleted `/index.html` (root)
‚úÖ Deleted `/public/index.html`
‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub
‚úÖ Now obl.ee will:
   1. Run `npm run build` (from oblien.json)
   2. Build from `/src` using Vite
   3. Output to `/dist` with NEW credentials
   4. Serve from `/dist` (with outputDirectory in oblien.json)

## What's Deployed Now

- Commit: `397245c - Remove root index.html - use only dist version`
- obl.ee will rebuild with correct version

## Next Steps

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for obl.ee to finish rebuilding

2. **Close ALL browsers** (to clear any memory cache)

3. **Open fresh incognito window:**
   - Chrome: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N`
   - Firefox: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`

4. **Go to:** https://creative-studio-saas.obl.ee/

5. **Check Console (F12):**
   Should see:
   ```
   üîç Supabase Config Debug:
   URL: https://gvipnadjxnjznjzvxqvg.supabase.co ‚úÖ
   ```

6. **Try Sign Up!**

## Expected Result

‚úÖ No more `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`
‚úÖ Page source shows Vite-built version (with cache headers)
‚úÖ Authentication works with new Supabase
‚úÖ Bundle has new credentials

## If Still Showing Old

Check obl.ee dashboard for:
- Build log (should show "vite build")
- Deployment status (should be "Success")
- "Clear cache" or "Redeploy" button

The fix IS deployed now. Just wait for rebuild and test in incognito! üéâ
